Greetings, salutations, holas, and welcome to the RealCodez screencasts
thingamabob. At least, the soft open version. 

I was listening to one of the first [Greater Than Code](http://www.greaterthancode.com/) 
podcasts with 
 [Avdi Grimm](https://www.greaterthancode.com/podcast/episode-002-avdi-grimm/)
 and during their discussion, Avdi shared some of the behind-the-scenes
 production work that goes into [RubyTapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/) that
 most are probably unaware of, and while that's necessary to produce a clean product,
 it has the one downside of "hiding the mess" from viewers. The panel went
 on to discuss the various Impostor Syndrome implications this presents. 
 
A lot of software instruction has this same challenge. In order to 
 clearly teach a specific technique, all of the usual real world clutter needs
 to be removed. But there are some interesting counter-examples. 
 
Geoffrey Grosenbach's PeepCode videos (now at PluralSight) include Play-by-Play episodes
showing real life peoples solving real life problems, which I was a big fan of ([this one with
Aaron Patterson and Corey Haines](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-aaroncorey) is fun).
[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052)
by Michael Feathers contains many samples of problems in real world code. Of course, 
[MythBusters](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/) is a great show, in part, because of the
insights into the discovery process, failures, warts and all.
  
With all of those various inspirations, I'd like to present to you a beta/pilot
episode of my new endeavor: RealCodez. "Where real world development meets 
real world failure and frustration for your entertainucation."

Special thanks to my son Sam, for editing and additional "contributions". 
Check out [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSpielberg/videos) for more wackiness. 

If you love it, hate it, wanna critique it, I'd love to hear your thoughts, 
so shoot me an email at chrismo@clabs.org.
