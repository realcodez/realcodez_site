My latest episode, [Part 3 of Gems Missing from Bundle Outdated](/2016/12/29/gems-missing-bundle-outdated-1-13-part-3.markdown) 
is done, and
with that part, I've finally published all of the parts on that. Editing followed the same, newish pipeline
established in [Part 2](/2016/12/13/gems-missing-bundle-outdated-1-13-part-2.markdown), but still required a bit of
time and I had a lot of material to edit down from. And I'm not practiced at that part of it yet, though there's 
probably only so many shortcuts that familiarity will breed there. By necessity, I'm more involved in the editing process,
making the decisions on the technical content. This may continue to slow the pace of new episodes, but -- I have a much
bigger elephant in the room right now: I have no audience :)

Somewhere since the last Behind the Scenes posting, the @realcodez twitter account reached 50 followers,
 which is a nice small milestone, but the first 
20 are friends and the next 30 are mostly entrepreneurial connects brought about by the helpful prompts of the Twitter 
client. I happy to have them, and I'm following as many of them as they are back to accounts like mine. But this isn't 
what we'd call a market audience. 

I'm experimenting with using Hootsuite to queue up a bunch of redundant tweets throughout a single day to try and 
promote new content, re-tweeting a lot of that on my personal account which does have a larger, more quality following,
but -- it's still rather limited. And who knows how many folks are just irritated at seeing me push my side project
that frequently, and of course how many still don't see any of them. I've had one or two folks ask me, "Hey, how's that
side project going?" "Oh, the one I've been busting my buns on for 2 months - it's fine." I've had the rare occasion to 
have a tweet of mine 
go on a mini-personal-scope viral adventure, so I know what that's like and of course nothing is happening with the
new tweets about realcodez.
  
I hope this isn't coming off whiny by the way, like I'm in the Skywalker lineage, it's not intended that way, I'm 
just calling out
to myself again the simple fact that I have no audience. 
 
And looking back over some of the free portions of Amy Hoy's [30x500](https://30x500.com/academy/) stuff, I've done it 
again, I'm going about this backwards.

If you're mentally (or verbally) asking "Again? What was the first thing?" A little side project called 
[Cashew](https://cashewapp.com). I'm the only customer 
of Cashew, and it's probably too niche to be a viable project for others, but it's good for a resume if nothing else, 
esp. for a backend programmer like myself.

Reading back over my [welcome article](/about), it's a good background of what inspired me to do this and what things 
I might be able to bring to the table. It still
 feels all viable and crap, but ... I have to be frank here: currently, I have no audience.
 
If I want to help be a resource to software devs who struggle with Impostor's Syndrome, who are even unawares of the
  larger backdrop brought by the shame that fuels the Impostor's, I need to go about connecting with an audience. Granted
  some content to begin is necessary and there's a chicken-and-egg thing afoot here (even though chicken don't have 
  feet), and
  maybe I got a little gung-ho with the screencast content ... like, what if screencasts aren't the thing people need or 
  want?
  
So - since I found a stopping point with the screencasts for now (though I do have raw material for probably 2 more 
episodes all 3 and a half hours of it - sheesh) - I've been trying to be
more intentional about my audience. Er, or at least thinking about ways to try to experiment with being more intentional
about finding an audience.

The thing is, I believe very strongly there's an audience out there for this stuff. And I also care a lot about it and 
I'm working in a world I'm very familiar with, items that are labeled "Good Things" by Amy. I'm trying to soak up
a lot of her principled advice in articles like this, 
["How do you create a product people want to buy?"](https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-do-you-create-a-product-people-want-to-buy).
The concepts are understandable, the "trick" (air quotes) is to be a bit disciplined about following them. If nothing else,
following step 1 (audience) first before step 2 (product).

And the more I get into this mindset, the more I realize there are still a lot of options in front of me to try and
pursue. It's easy for me to get focused on the limitations I have in any given day with the small amount of personal
time I have right now to put into this, and then have that morph unconsciously into "I'm stuck and I have no options
and this isn't going anywhere anyway." 

Which is classic shame, baby. Classic. Totes classic, even. 

It IS true that I don't have a ton of time to throw at this on any given day, but I'm not even 2 calendar months into
this process and I've actually accomplished quite a lot so far, esp. considering the holiday season which I didn't allow
to be encroached upon by my new side project. A lot of the accomplishments are below the water-line, but ... that's
like any other project I've ever worked on like ever.

But I need to make sure and not conclude from a daily experience with my limitations that I'm completely stuck and out
 of options. 
 
Step 1 for myself when faced with shame: ask myself, what are my options? That's not only good advice for myself, but
good RealCodez advice for my audience, as yet to be introduced. (Except for you, of course. Obviously you're right there 
right now. Probably.)
