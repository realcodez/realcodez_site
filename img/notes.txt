Nov 2016 - background.2.xcf is the project for both background.2.png
and background.2-sel.png. background.2.png is the "Background" image in
Vimeo Appearance tab. background.2-sel.png is the "Thumbnail" image in
Vimeo Appearance tab. "background.2-sel.png" was made from
background.2.xcf by selecting the RealCodez thumbnail layer, then using
the export selection script-fu. If you're in a GIMP install without
that extension, you can download it here:
http://registry.gimp.org/node/14315 - and put it in the scripts folder
in your GIMP install. On OS X, that's in ~/Library/Application
Support/GIMP/2.8/scripts. Then inside GIMP, select Filters / Script-Fu
/ Refresh Scripts.
